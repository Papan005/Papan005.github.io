                         <h2>Features of the Animal Kingdom</h2> 
                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p>Scientists predict that only 15% of species are known to man from the estimated 8.7 million species. That leaves almost 85% species yet to be discovered. Only about 953,434 species of animals have been catalogued in the Animal Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The Animal Kingdom, also known as Kingdom Animalia, is one of the major classifications in biological taxonomy, grouping together all living organisms that are considered animals. This kingdom is distinct from other life forms like plants, fungi, and microorganisms, and includes an incredibly diverse range of species, from tiny insects to massive whales.</p>
                        <p>Despite the vast diversity within the animal kingdom, all animals share certain common traits that set them apart from organisms in other kingdoms. Animals are eukaryotic and multicellular, with most possessing specialized tissues. They are also generally motile, at least during certain stages of their life cycle. Unlike autotrophs such as plants, which make their own food through photosynthesis, or fungi, which break down food outside their bodies, all animals are heterotrophic. This means they must consume living or dead organic matter for energy. Animals can be grouped based on their diets into carnivores (meat-eaters), herbivores (plant-eaters), omnivores (eating both plants and animals), or parasites (organisms that feed off others).</p>

                         <h2>How are Animal Kingdoms classified?</h2> 
                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p>Animals are classified according to morphological and developmental characteristics, such as a body plan. With the exception of sponges, the animal body plan is symmetrical. This means that their distribution of body parts is balanced along an axis. Additional characteristics that contribute to animal classification include the number of tissue layers formed during development, the presence or absence of an internal body cavity, and other features of embryological development.</p>
                        <p>Another key aspect of animal classification is the type of symmetry exhibited by the organism. Animals can be categorized as asymmetrical, bilaterally symmetrical, or radially symmetrical. Asymmetrical animals, like sponges, lack a symmetrical body plan altogether. Bilaterally symmetrical animals, such as humans and most other animals, have a body plan that can be divided into mirror-image halves along a central axis, which often correlates with a more complex organization and greater mobility. Radially symmetrical animals, such as jellyfish and starfish, have body parts arranged around a central axis, allowing them to interact with their environment from all directions. These symmetry types play a crucial role in determining the evolutionary relationships among different animal groups and influence their behavior and ecological roles. The phylogenetic tree of animals (as can be seen below) is based on morphological, fossil, and genetic evidence.</p>

                         <h2>Why Endangered Species Matter?</h2> 
                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p>According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/about/background-history" target="_blank">Red List of Threatened Species</a>, over 26,500 species are in danger of extinction. This includes 40 percent of amphibians, 34 percent of conifers, 33 percent of reef-building corals, 25 percent of mammals and 14 percent of birds. In the U.S., over 1,600 species are listed as threatened or endangered.</p>

                        </blockquote>-->
                        <p>While it may seem unimportant if we lose one salamander or rat species, it matters because all species are connected through their interactions in a web of life. A balanced and biodiverse ecosystem is one in which each species plays an important role and relies on the services provided by other species to survive. Healthy ecosystems are more productive and resistant to disruptions. <em>“When you lose one species, it affects the ecosystem and everything around it gets a little bit more fragile while it adapts to change,”</em> said Kelsey Wooddell, assistant director of the Earth Institute Center for Environmental Sustainability. </p>

                        </footer>  
                        <p>Extinction is hard to see. We may not realize how much of the natural world has been lost because the “baseline” shifts with every generation. Past generations would regard what we see as natural today as terribly damaged, and what we see as damaged today, our children will view as natural. Below are some other things we can all do to protect endangered species and prevent extinction:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Eat less meat. Soybean production, a major driver of deforestation, primarily feeds livestock.</li>
                            <li>Buy organic food. Organic farmers use only non-synthetic or natural pesticides, reducing toxicity to other organisms.</li>
                            <li>Choose sustainable seafood. Refer to the Marine Stewardship Council for a list of certified sustainable fish.</li>
                            <li>Compost food waste. In New York City, compost is used for urban farming and gardening, which supports pollinator habitats.</li>
                            <li>Buy wood and paper products certified by the Forest Stewardship Council to ensure they come from responsibly managed forests.</li>
                            <li>Reduce your use of plastic.</li>
                            <li>If you have a garden, plant native shrubs and flowers to attract butterflies and other pollinators. Milkweed is especially beneficial for monarch butterflies.</li>
                            <li>Set up a beehive.</li>
                            <li>Support and get involved with organizations that are helping endangered animals.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p></p>
